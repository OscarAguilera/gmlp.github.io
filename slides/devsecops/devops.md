<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">We think that DevOps can be defined by two related ideas. 
First, DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together through the entire service lifecycle, from the design and development process all the way to production support.
Second, DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use of many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work.</p>

 <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> Then what it is? DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development Dev and software operation Ops. The main characteristic of the DevOps movement, is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management.</p>

 <p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out"> DevOps culture allows deploying code to production faster and in an automated way. It helps to increases an organization's speed to deliver application and services. It can be defined as an alignment of development and IT operation.</p>

>ITIL = DevOps 

IT service management is a realization that service delivery is an important part of the overall <b>software development lifecycle</b>, which should properly be managed from design to development to deployment to maintenance to retirement. This means that the ITSM is clearly one of the DevOps ancestors.

DevSecOps strives to automate core security tasks by embedding security controls and processes into the DevOps workflow. DevSecOps originally focused primarily on automating code security and testing, but now it also encompasses more operations-centric controls.
