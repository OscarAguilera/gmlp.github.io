## CONTINUOUS DELIVERY

* Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way.

* This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button.


## CONTINUOUS DELIVERY

* In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches, that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.
