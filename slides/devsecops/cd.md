# CONTINUOUS DELIVERY

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Continuous delivery (CD)Â is a software engineering practice in which teams develop, build, test, and release software in short cycles. It depends on automation at every stage so that cycles can be both quick and reliable.</p>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">With continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements. However, if you truly want to get the benefits of continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible to make sure that you release small batches, that are easy to troubleshoot in case of a problem.</p>


# CONTINUOUS DELIVERY 

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">The goal of Continuous Delivery is to make deployment predictable and scheduled in a routine manger. It is achieved by ensuring that the code always remains in a state where it can be deployed whenever demanded, even when an entire team of developers is constantly making changes to it. </p>

# CONTINUOUS DELIVERY

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way.</p>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button.</p>

# CONTINUOS DELIVERY 
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">BEST PRACTICES</p>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Builds should be done before 5 minutes</P>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Commit small bits</P>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Do not leave the build broken</P>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Use a trunk-base development or branch-base (git) flow</P>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Do not allow flaky tests. </P>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">The Build Should return a status and an artifact.</P>
